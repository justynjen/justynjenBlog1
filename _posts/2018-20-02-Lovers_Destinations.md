Are you thinking you still need to spice things up more and make all of February your time for love? Then read this, take notes and book a trip for you and your special someone ASAP!

<h4>Disappointed with how your Valentine’s activities went?</h4>

Here is a quick backstory on me. I have never traveled with, nor do I have a significant other. I am merely writing this more as a “Top Place you will feel left out if you travel alone and single.” Or, “Top destinations I felt awkward traveling because everyone had a boyfriend except me.” So where should you go with that lover of yours for the most romantic day of the year?

<h4>Stop 1: Venice, Italy</h4>

Hello romantic Italian men and strangers selling roses as you try to eat your dinner alone and in peace. Hello waiters that buy you your dinner and surprise you with roses from said strangers because they feel bad you are ALWAYS eating alone. Hello sitting at the bar because all the tables are taken by cute couples playing footsie under the table.
Wandering the piazzas’ and cruising down the canals of Venice is the perfect way to stoke the flames. It is easily one of the most romantic cities in the world, how could it not be? The Cathedral is built in floor to ceiling gold. It is a city of masquerades and art. Of warm breezes and sitting outdoors to eat a candle lit dinner.
If you are not okay with your relationship status as a big fat single, don’t go to Venice alone, because you’ll be sad. But if you can own it, like I did, you’ll end up with a lot of roses, glasses of wine and free meals to eat away your pain. And did I mention, if you look sad enough, you might just end up with a couple free Gondola Boat ride? I am telling you it’s these ITALIANS. So go there with your special someone, or check it out alone and you’ll likely fall in love with the romance of the Italian people who just want to make your vacation perfect.

<h4>Stop 2: Paris, France.</h4>

This is a no brainer. Who wouldn’t want to roam the Parisian streets hand in hand with Mr. Right? A picnic beneath the Eifel Tower as it twinkles, a walk through endless rooms of famous artwork, or enjoying each other’s company at a perfect French cafe. You can fall in love all over again in this city of love. There is even a whole bridge dedicated to it. Lock you love and throw away the key. Try not to fret though; if you go to France alone there is always the Red Light District and a good Moulin Rouge show to fill your empty, lonely nights.

<h4>Stop 3: Lake Bled, Slovenia</h4>

Lake Bled is one of the best places on this little earth. It is beautiful and so very magical. Go and join the lovers of the world, rowing a boat out to the middle of a lake where a beautiful, picturesque church lies. Then go ahead and have a romantic lunch while you’re over there. When you’re done you can hike up to the castle on the cliff and take cute photos of each other looking out over the Julian Alps. Finish off your stay with a walk around the lake, jumping in for a swim and laying around on the grass just relaxing. There is no stress here; it is the best place to be left alone to relax or quiet time spent alone with your sweetheart.

<h4>Stop 4: Salzburg, Austria</h4>

The Romantic activities here are endless. Hire a bike and ride through beautiful Austrian countryside and maybe stop for a picnic. Walk through the forests around the castles then have a rest with another picnic overlooking the city. Head to the park where the famed Sound of Music Pavilionis and dance around, singing about your endless love, before having yet another picnic surrounded by beautiful flowers in the Rose Garden. Between the endless picnic spots, endless music playing in the streets, and endless beauty around every corner; Salzburg is a must do for couples in the mood for a quiet city to have all to themselves. Just think Mozart and Julia Andrews, nothing could be better right?

If this hasn’t inspired you to travel with your loved one after this V-day, I don’t know what will. Find the perfect city to take your perfect person and stoke the flames of your relationship. There are a million cities out there that you can argue to be more romantic or more beautiful but I know these cities will remind you why you fell in love and bring out the beauty you see in each other. I know they reminded me how beautiful the world is and how amazing people are every day.
