Boston is one of the oldest cities in America, and one of the only places that you can go that makes you feel some history of our country. This was my first visit and I instantly fell in love. I ate all the corn chowder, got lost along the Freedom Trail and bundled up against the cold with some tasty cupcakes and coffee. Below I have shared with you 15 of my favorite photos from my weekend in Boston.&nbsp;

Beware, these pictures are going to make you wish you had a trip planned to Boston right away!&nbsp;
