The first thing that you should know about me is that I LOVE to read. I was that nerd that read under the covers every night thinking that my mom just wouldn't notice. I just wanted to share my favorite books with you that are totally going to change your life. I know they changed mine!&nbsp;

#### Better than Before by Gretchen Rubin

I have said before that I love Gretchen Rubin and since I had read her other book called “The Happiness Project” I thought that this would be a lot of repeating in this book. I couldn’t have been more wrong. “Better Than Before” is packed with new thoughts about making good habits and breaking the bad ones. She brings so many different ideas that no matter who you are or what you are struggling with, something will stick out to you personally and provide direction.

#### And Still I Rise: A book of Poems by Maya Angelou

I can’t say that I am really big into poetry but anything written by Maya Angelou has a way of resonating with a person. “And Still I Rise” is no exception. With these poems you feel her meaning in each line and something will ring true for you. I know Maya Angelou’s poetry helps me think about things in a new light.

#### Stalking God: My Unorthodox Search for Something to Believe In by Anjali Kumar

I personally feel like I can relate strongly with Anjali Kumar in her book called “Stalking God.” Religion can be found everywhere as Kumar demonstrates in her book. She travels far and wide and nothing was too out there for her to want to experience. Meeting with all kinds of spiritual giants she retells what she finds in this light hearted story of “Stalking God.”

#### The Power of Vulnerability by Brene Brown

You can’t go wrong with any Brene Brown book but I love this one in particular because it made me look inward to the kind of person I am and how I talk to myself. I am incredibly judgemental to who I am sometimes and that kind of self talk can be extremely detrimental. Brown also helped me realize how I interact with others and the words I use to communicate. She brought so much of my subconscious thoughts and doings to like that I recommend Brene Brown and “The Power of Vulnerability” to all.

#### You are a Badass by Jen Sincero

You could possibly say that reading this book was the most pivotal moment in my determination to make money while I traveled and to be positive in all my thinking. I read it back in November of 2016 and have since read it multiple times. It outlined the life and person I wanted and how I needed to believe to achieve my dreams. This book is for everyone desiring to be a true badass at life. If you get the audible version of this book, Jen Sincero narrates and listening to her is even more inspiring. Get a copy and follow along taking notes in the margins and make it yours.

#### The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho

"The Alchemist" was first written in Portuguese by a Brazilian author named Paulo Coelho but once it became an international best seller it has since been translated into 70 languages. This is a wonderful story of travel and discovery and a story that every person can relate to. We all have a secret dreamer inside of us that can connect to this story of adventure in many ways. I loved it as pleasure book but also as a book to inspire me to always remember that the journey is part of the adventure.

#### Steal like an artist by Austin Kleon

This is a creative thinking self help book by Austin Kleon and has helped me on many occasions. "Steal Like An Artist" is an easy read and taught me how to better find my creative side. I go through many phases where I feel totally uninspired and not sure what to do next. Kleon presents his ideas in a clean and straightforward way that really help me get back on track and stop stressing the small things that can drive away my creativity. Even if you aren’t looking to write a book or become the next Leonardo, you should let this book help you express your creative side. I believe that being creative can impact all aspects of your life in a positive way.

#### The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz

A truly enlightening book I recommend everyone read is called The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz. He outlines four different self attributes that when put together will help you to become the person you have always wanted to be. This book had powerful concepts that, if followed, will help us to love ourselves more, improve our relationships with others and help us to achieve our goals. We can find inner peace that will help us to live our heaven on earth.

#### The Seven Wonders That Will Change Your Life by Glenn Beck and Dr. Keith Ablow

This is a unique combination of life experiences from Glenn and keen observation from Dr. Ablow. When you add both insights and experiences, this wonderful book of thought and inspiration was created and can change your life. If you are looking to transform your life in any way, you should pick this book up. It’s sole purpose is to help you reconstruct your thoughts and actions and inspire you with helpful tools to take that first step towards your transformation.

Even though I am crazy busy most of the time, I always find time to read. It calms my mind and helps me refocus. If you have any books that help or inspire you please let me know what they are! I am always looking for my next good read.
