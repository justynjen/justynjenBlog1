## Matsumoto Castle and Museum

<br>Matsumoto was another day full of blessings. I got up a little late, but still managed to catch the desired train to get my journey started. From Hakone is was about 4 hours journey total. It was pouring rain as we neared Matsumoto and I was worried that it would rain all day. However when I stepped off the train the rain had cleared and the sun was coming out with full force.

### Arriving in Matsumoto

<br>I exited the train station and walked to my hostel. I was staying at a nice little joint just outside of the main square. However, when I arrived no one was there. A sign was up telling me that I could store my bags and luggage at the museum. As I rolled back to the castle and museum area I found lockers inside. I was minding my own business searching for coins in my purse when one of the employees came up to me and said they would store my bags for me free of charge! Gratefully I handed over my stuff. I got lucky one more time because the castle and museum were free that day as well!<br>&nbsp;

### The Museum

<br>I started out making my way through the museum. It is full of beautiful ancient artworks and statues. They have a miniature than shows you what Matsumoto looked like hundreds of years ago, as well as a timeline of the history of the city. After checking out all the artifacts I decided to head out into the sun and see what the castle was all about.

### <br><br>The Castle

The Matsumoto castle is so beautiful! It’s this stunning wooden structure surrounded by beautiful green grass and tons of flowers, encircled by a large moat and what seems like a very large zen garden. (Which I totally rolled my suitcase through and ruined the zen…oops)<br><br>I walked around the outside to the line that was formed to go inside. There is a wait time, as they only allow a certain number of people in at a time. I worried a bit that it would be hours – since it was free today, but I was next up within 30 minutes. Upon entrance they ask you to take your shoes off and they offer you a plastic bag to store them in. Then you go inside and take the tour around the wooden interior, climbing the steep stairs, sometimes at a 60 degree angle and as tall as 41 centimeters apart. It is no longer furnished, but it’s really cool to see the layout and walk on the perfectly smoothed wood.

### <br>Tea Ceremonies

<br>On the way out some Japanese geishas invited me to have some tea and treats with them. Excited to have tea, I sat down and chatted about my home and theirs. I could have as much tea and treats as I wanted as well. It was such a lovely experience that it ended up being one of my favorite days.<br><br>You can read about my whole Japanese itinerary here!!
