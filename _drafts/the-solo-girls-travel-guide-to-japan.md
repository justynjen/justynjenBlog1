## Temples, Shrines, Bullet Trains, Stardom.. Need I say more?

You really do only live once and while going solo some places might not be as fun, Japan was the perfect place for me, myself and I.

Having just finished a solo tour around Japan I would recommend all the single girls out there book a ticket to this oriental heaven. &nbsp;I love traveling solo but before I left this time, everyone told me not to travel alone to Japan. It’s not that it’s dangerous, cause it’s 100% not, people just said I would be alone A LOT and that it’s not the place you go to meet people. I figured that wouldn’t be too bad, then maybe I could get lots of work done but that wasn’t the case at all! I ended up meeting loads of amazing Japanese people who endured the language barrier because they genuinely wanted to be my friend and get to know me.

### First Stop: Tokyo

My trip was fast and furious. I got to see a lot in a short time. I started my trip in Tokyo; the concrete jungle. In Tokyo I embraced everything Japanese, from wandering through giant buildings to praying quietly in a Shrine just across the street from one of the busiest places I have ever been. I am not usually a fan of big cities, but because Tokyo offers the crazy metropolis of New York on steroids as well as the quiet temples and Shrines, it is a must. Not only do you have quiet and crazy you have food! All kinds of food, things that you didn’t even know were food, like octopus balls... You can recieve your sushi on a conveyor belt or, even better, &nbsp;you can have giant robots serve you then put on a show while you eat.

### Second Stop: Nikko

Next stop, Nikko. Make sure to hop on a train from Tokyo one morning and check out this city which is full to the brim of temples and shrines, monkeys and mountains. You can visit all the shrines and then take the bus to the lake to enjoy some waterfalls and great views of the mountains. You have to stop in one of the small shops and get hot ramen while you take in the cold air and breathtaking views.

### Third Stop: Hakone

I headed back to Tokyo for the night and the next morning I was on the train out to Hakone. I was really looking forward to seeing Mt Fuji and relaxing the night away in a traditional Onsen! I took a bus straight away to the lake where you could view the majestic mountain from. I was so lucky to have amazing visibility and I spent the entire day basically just staring at it. Then I hiked back the 6 miles to my hostel through beautiful clean forests.

### Fourth Stop: Matsumoto

After 2 nights in Hakone, and lots of hiking, I decided to head onwards to Matsumoto. Matsumoto was a dream. The castle there is so beautiful, especially at night. After walking through the castle you can visit the museum they have, then enjoy some tea at a traditional tea ceremony and walk through the adorable shopping street. I got the perfect ‘sushi washi’ tape which was great for adding memories and mementos to my journal.

### Fifth Stop: Kanazawa Via the Kurobe Alpine Route

In the morning from Matsumoto I did the Kurobe Alpine route to Kanazawa. I was able to see the Kurobe Dam and the snow wall! I spent the following couple of nights in Kanazawa. &nbsp;Known best for its sushi, which I helped myself to lots of, I managed to try some kinds that I wouldn’t have otherwise eaten, so it was fun. Make sure to check out the gardens and castle here. The gardens are some of the most lovely in Japan and the castle is just as beautiful as you would expect a castle to be. You can also wander through the geisha and the samurai districts that are unlike any other!

### Sixth Stop: Shirakawa-Go

Enroute to Takayama I made a stop at Shirakawa, a unesco world heritage site. It’s pretty breathtaking when your bus comes around the corner of the mountains and you are deposited in a valley of beautiful ancient homes and a culture that has been untouched from the world for ages. The bus ride is only an hour from Kanazawa and then another hour afterwards to Takayama. I was able to just buy my tickets at the station which made this travel day simple.

### Seventh Stop: Takayama

From there I headed to Takayama where I was able to ride a bike all over. I visited the teddy bear museum and caf&eacute;, then explored tons of the cutest little streets that I have been too. Takayama was beautiful and while you can see plenty of beautiful things, I was also able to catch up on writing and relax for a bit.

### Eighth Stop: Kyoto

I was going to need that bit of rest I got because next I was off to Kyoto where there is so much to do and see. Kyoto is rather large, and you can basically take a bus to anywhere you’d like with a day pass of only 500 yen. It’s your best bet in this huge and beautiful city. Make sure you make it to the golden temple, the Fushi Imari Shrine and the largest Pagoda in Japan known as Tō-ji which stands as a symbol of Kyoto.

### Ninth Stop: Hiroshima

From Kyoto I took the bullet train to Hiroshima, which was my favorite day of my whole trip. I was able to learn and see so much in that day that I was truly amazed. Even though I didn’t get up as early as I had hoped, and it poured rain all day, it only made the experience that much better. I visited the Memorial Peace Park, the Museum and the A-bomb Dome. I got to enjoy traditional food as well while I spent the day soaking up history.

### Tenth Stop: Nara

I took the train that night to Nara, for deer (the actual animal) and the last of the temples and shrines I would see. Nara was the capital of Japan at one point, but now it is a relatively small but extremely beautiful with wild deer roaming free just waiting for the next tourist with a selfie stick and a biscuit. It is also home to the second largest Pagoda in Japan as well as a special sushi wrapped in leaves (but you don’t eat the leaves lol). After a full day exploring Nara I jumped on a bullet train and headed back to Tokyo for one more day in the big city before flying out.

### So, have I convinced you?

Finally, why should you go to Japan by yourself? Well for one, it’s so safe. I never once felt like I was in any sort of danger. Even though many of the people did not speak the best English and I knew all of 5 words in Japanese, they were so helpful and some of the kindest and happiest people that I have ever had the privilege to meet.

Travelling around Japan was extremely easy. With the Japan Rail pass you can get on most all of the trains without having a reservation and get to every corner of the country. I loved it because then money was not an issue since I had pre-purchased the pass giving me the freedom to go where I wanted, when I wanted. It was also awesome because I got to go places I may have not gone if I had to pay for each ticket. It is definitely a must!

Japan gave me a lot of time to self-reflect and debate my future though as well. While I wandered through silent shrines by myself then laughed over ramen and seared tuna with incredible people that I met in every city, I learned much about who I am. I am going to miss the constantly smiling Japanese people, my temporary fame just for having curly, unkempt blonde hair, matcha everything, THE BEST SUSHI, the temples, adorable deer and the contrasting cities. I met some of the best folks out there on this trip who taught me a lot about the kind of person I want to be. So to everyone who told me not to go to Japan alone, you were wrong. I would say Japan is one of the best countries for a girl to travel solo in and I can’t wait to go back.
