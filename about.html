				<h4>I'm Justyn Jen</h4>
				<p>My name is Justyn. Pronounced Just(in). Most people want to know if I was given this name for a reason, but as I always tell them, no my name has no meaning. It is just a name my dad was set on naming me whether I was a boy or not. I know now that I was given this name because I was meant to stand out and what better way to stand out then to be a girl with boy’s name. That’s the first question I get everytime I introduce myself. </p>

		<p>As for my life, I am pretty busy. I have been traveling the world for just about 3 years now. Before this I worked never ending hours in many long term care facilities. I escaped that endless job for a world of travel, where I still work just as hard, but I get to visit beautiful new places and meet amazing people all over the world.

		 I work as a Virtual Assistant and a Web Developer. This basically means that I do a lot of different things. I help run people’s blogs, membership sites, newsletters, Facebook groups and Instagram accounts. I also build beautiful websites, like this one. For a while, I based myself in Bali. Surrounded by the best expat family I could have ever asked for. Now I find myself doing my best to enjoy a European Winter, while maintaining the full time work schedule that I have. </p>

		 <h4>Through this journey I hope to bring you a HUGE guide to working online FULL TIME while also traveling FULL TIME. This means: how to work from anywhere, how to be the most productive when working, how to still enjoy travelling, how to make friends and work, and much much more! </h4>

		 <p>This blog is also going to be a bit of a journal for me that I hope you don’t mind me sharing with you. However, I also hope that it comes as an amazing resource for anyone out there who is wondering if they can do something like this, how much it will cost, and how easy (or not so easy) it can be. If you ever have any questions, please feel free to contact me!

		 Thanks for joining me on this little journey. </p>
