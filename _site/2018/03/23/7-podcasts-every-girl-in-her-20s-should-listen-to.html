  <h2 class="centered"> 7 Podcasts Every Girl In Her 20’s Should Listen To... </h2>
  <hr class="center"> </hr>
  <p>  </p>
  <div class="posts">
   <p>Ever since dropping out of school I have tried to find ways to continue teaching myself new things. I decided to do that through podcasts. Podcasts are amazing for many reasons. You can listen to Podcasts that teach you something new and interesting, ones that inspire you or just ones that make you laugh out loud. In personal life and work life, podcasts can be amazing. I try to listen to one every morning with my breakfast and coffee, before I start my day! Here are some of my favorites!</p>

<h4 id="1-happier-with-gretchen-rubin">1. Happier with Gretchen Rubin</h4>

<p><img src="/uploads/happierpodcast.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I love listening to <a href="https://gretchenrubin.com/podcasts/">Gretchen Rubin in her Happier podcast</a> mostly because she is real with you. She doesn’t make things complicated but she teaches you how to be happier in your own life and with yourself. A recent podcast she did was on just doing something badly. Much of the time we get caught up on how well other people are doing things or by how much you think you see other people accomplishing in their own lives. Turn that around and see how much you can get done in your day or life by sometimes just doing it badly to get it done and checked off the list. If we wait to do things perfectly or even done what we see as well, could mean we never get it done. Long story short, Gretchen really taught me to stress less and just get things done.</p>

<h4 id="2-we-have-concerns-with-jeff-cannata-and-anthony-carboni">2. We Have Concerns with Jeff Cannata and Anthony Carboni</h4>

<p><img src="/uploads/wehaveconcernspodcast.png" alt="" />
<a href="http://wehaveconcerns.com/">We Have Concerns</a> is actually one my sister introduced me to when I told her she should try listening to podcasts. It is a shorter but informative listen that brings facts and humor as Jeff and Anthony discuss current events to old history, science, philosophy and more. The episodes are only 15-20 minutes long and worth listening to. They make me think and laugh at the same time which is good for the mind… I think LOL</p>

<h4 id="3-enwaken-radio-with-david-morelli">3. Enwaken Radio with David Morelli</h4>

<p><img src="/uploads/enwakenpodcast.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I stumbled upon this one while searching for more inspiration and it was just what I needed to hear. <a href="https://www.enwaken.com/">The podcast</a> I listened to and think every girl in her 20’s should listen to was about choosing to stop fighting simplicity. How often do we find ourselves over complicating things just because we think “Well, it can’t actually be this easy, right?” Wrong! It can be that easy and free flowing. If something is simple or comes easily, it doesn’t mean it wasn’t right or that something terrible is going to follow. Choose to free yourself and let life be more simple.</p>

<h4 id="4-goal-digger-podcast-by-jenna-kutcher">4. Goal Digger Podcast by Jenna Kutcher</h4>

<p><img src="/uploads/goaldiggerpodcast.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This HAS to be my favorite, most helpful, inspiring and downright awesome podcast I have subscribed to. Go subscribe to <a href="http://podcast.jennakutcher.com/">Jenna Kutcher’s Goal Digger podcast</a> right now and let it change the way you think about yourself and your life. This week I listened to episode 131: 5 Big Lies That Are Holding You Back and it is a great one as usual. This podcast may seem like it’s only for entrepreneurs but you can apply the principles to life in your 20’s no problem.</p>

<h4 id="5-let-it-out-with-katie-dalebout">5. Let It Out with Katie Dalebout</h4>

<p><img src="/uploads/letitoutpodcast.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now this is a bit longer per episode so if you are looking for something to listen to while cleaning or driving or you just find yourself bored one afternoon then delve into <a href="http://katiedalebout.com/podcast/">this podcast with Katie Dalebout</a> as she invites a different guest speaker on and talks about life in general. Whether it’s a light conversation or super personal, talking about productivity or sex; she digs into it. More than just talking though, she brings an informative and down to earth aspectic to her shows that I found I enjoyed and think you might as well.</p>

<h4 id="6-the-upgrade-by-lifehacker">6.  The Upgrade by Lifehacker</h4>

<p>I am new to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tag/the-upgrade">this podcast</a> but enjoy it so far because it is a light listen “How to” on all kinds of topic such as: how to talk to people or more importantly, how to identify a cult and how to prevent your mind from being hacked. One episode I particularly enjoyed was “How to Be a Clean Person with Jolie Kerr” because at one point in the episode she talks about keeping your towels cleaner, softer and fluffy. I don’t have a struggle with this exactly seeing as I am always using other people’s towels in my nomadic lifestyle but my sister on the other hand has a weird obsession with laundry and I immediately thought of her. That’s another great thing about podcasts is no matter what lifestyle you lead each show or episode can be relevant to you for many different reasons. Jolie brings up more great tips on getting rid of weird breath or stinky feet that everyone should know about as well.</p>

<h4 id="7-my-favorite-murder-with-karen-kilgariff-and-georgia-hardstark">7. My Favorite Murder with Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark</h4>

<p><img src="/uploads/myfavoritemurder.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.myfavoritemurder.com/">This is a great podcast</a> for all you true crime lovers with a funny twist. These ladies are hilarious and I never get tired of them or each crime they discuss. They are great at keeping the mood up even talking about such horrific subject matter. I would love to have these gals for best friends. Their humor is right up my alley but it might not be for everybody. Hear them out and you just might get hooked.</p>

<p>There are many ways you can listen to podcasts. I use DoublePod on Android and I know my sister uses Podcasts on her iPhone as well as subscribing on iTunes. Plus you can go straight to the websites of each podcast and a lot of the time watch videos as well as listen to the show.</p>

<p>I am always looking for more fun podcasts of all kinds to listen to so comment with your favorites and tell me why!</p>
