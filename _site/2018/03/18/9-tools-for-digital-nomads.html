  <h2 class="centered"> 9 Tools for Digital Nomads </h2>
  <hr class="center"> </hr>
  <p>  </p>
  <div class="posts">
   <p>Today I am sharing with you my top 9 tools that you better have in your Digital Nomad toolkit. These are the things that I use everyday to get my work done, invoice my clients, track my time and make sure that I am getting my tasks done. Whether you are just starting out in this Digital Nomad journey or you are a seasoned worker, I think that these digital nomad tools will really help you!</p>

<h4 id="asana">Asana</h4>

<p>Asana is where I have my entire life. I recently added my sister to my own personal Asana and I think that it may have overwhelmed her right away. I keep anything and everything I want to accomplish, work or personal, in here. Nothing feels better than making a list and checking things off. I am totally that person that puts, buy a bottle of water on my to do list, just so I can feel like I did something today.</p>

<p>At this time I am a member of 5 Asana workspaces and I love it. I would be nowhere without my Asana. The only thing I wish was that it could show you your tasks for every workspace, in one place. Like you could see an ultimate task list. Other than that, I love Asana, it keeps me going.</p>

<h4 id="airtable">Airtable</h4>

<p>Airtable is new in my toolbox and I am sad I didn’t have it before now. Anyone who knows me, knows that I have an intense google drive. I have spreadsheets and lists and plans and finances and clients and dates and EVERYTHING.</p>

<p>Enter Airtable : Airtable has changed my work game for me. You can create calendars and schedules for your blog, social media, other groups and more. I have an Airtable that has all my ideas in it, along with the content calendar that we have going on for one of my clients. We can both access and edit it, and it really helps up keep everything together. It also helps us remember what needs to be posted when, what blog post I should be working on and more.</p>

<p>The calendar feature in Airtable is my favorite. If you are working for multiple clients, I suggest that you get this figured out right away. It will change the game for you too and has become a must need digital nomad tool.</p>

<h4 id="google-drive---docs-and-sheets">Google Drive - Docs and Sheets</h4>

<p>Like I said above, my google drive is INTENSE. This is where I keep everything. I have entire folders just for my finances, where I track all my money and scan in and link all my receipts. My finances folder is probably my most proud accomplishment of 2017. I LOVE IT.</p>

<p>I also have a folder for every client that I work for where I keep their branding, what they expect from me, our contract and terms and more. Anything that they share with me goes in that folder and then all those folders go in my Freelancing folder. It’s amazing for my organization.</p>

<h4 id="andco">Andco</h4>

<p>This is also new to me. I am still figuring it out but Andco is an app that you can download on your phone. It handles a lot for your finances, scheduling invoices and tracking your hours. I love this because I have been looking for a great way to send and track invoices and this seems like the best way to do it. I will keep you updated on if this stays in my digital nomad toolkit or not.</p>

<h4 id="lastpass">LastPass</h4>

<p>Lastpass is where it is at for clients and password sharing. As soon as I started getting more and more clients I realized that I needed like 1 million passwords from ALL of them. Having a way to organize these passwords and keep them safe is very important. Lastpass can be a little weird to set up at first - and you do have to add the extension to your Chrome otherwise it won’t work. But once you have it setup, it will change your life. It’s such a great digital nomad tool to have.</p>

<p>If your client hasn’t set it up yet, educate them on why they need it and then they can send you all of their passwords. The key feature is you can’t see their password and then can take them away from you at anytime, so it’s very safe for them and for you.</p>

<h4 id="tailwinds">Tailwinds</h4>

<p>THIS IS WHERE IT IS AT. I think that everyone needs to have Pinterest for their business. There are very few businesses that wouldn’t benefit in some way from Pinterest. So if you aren’t on Pinterest yet, or you aren’t using it to ROCK your business then click <a href="https://www.tailwindapp.com/i/justynjen">HERE RIGHT NOW</a>. And come back to this post when you have Pinterest going. Because if you aren’t pinning, you aren’t winning.</p>

<p>Tailwinds helps you stay active on Pinterest. It helps you to be pinning throughout the day, but unlike bots that people use to stay active on Instagram, Tailwinds is all set up by you. I spend 2 hours at the beginning of every week setting up my Tailwinds for the week ahead. I set up all my pins, repins and likes through Tailwinds and then I let it roll with it everyday. I love Pinterest so I still get on a few times a day and do other things - but I am no longer falling into the Pinterest hole when I am meant to be doing other work. Get Tailwinds and get on Pinterest! A must have digital nomad tool!</p>

<h4 id="slack">Slack</h4>

<p>Slack is really great if you are on any type of team. I think that if you have more than 4 team members, you should be using Slack. You can create channels for certain projects and then you can also just direct message the people that you work with. This is so much more organized and easier than trying to talk to people on messenger or Whatsapp which is what I do the rest of the time.</p>

<h4 id="zoom">Zoom</h4>

<p>Zoom is amazing for meetings. I use to always talk with people over Skype but my Skype seemed to always be acting up. On Zoom you can talk to people with or without the camera, you can create a zoom link and send it to anyone and then you are all ready to go. Just go into your zoom meeting and it runs great. Even when my wifi isn’t as great, zoom is one digital nomad too that never lets me down. I will always use Zoom for meetings now.</p>

<h4 id="transferwise">Transferwise</h4>

<p>Transferwise is my favorite way to get paid. It takes no fees and no time. Unlike Paypal. Paypal is the worst! Unless you are going to be doing direct bank transfers with people, then Transferwise is the way to go. With this, all that people need from you is your email and they can send you money. It gives the best conversion rate if you are sending to a different currency which is great! Give it a try and I promise you are going to be making all your clients pay you through this.</p>

<p>So there are my top tools for digital nomads. Whether you haven’t even started applying for jobs yet, or like me, you work for about 300 clients, it’s not too late to set these apps up and get yourself organized. I know that organization with these digital nomad tools will change the way that you run your business and will change the way that you get things done. When you are more organized you are able to work more on actual work instead of looking for things or just trying to figure out how you are going to invoice someone (which I have spent many hours doing before). You are going to be able to work harder and in the end make more money and work less; which is what everyone’s goal is, right?!</p>

<p>What apps and digital nomad tools can you not live without? Let me know in the comments! I am always looking for cool new tools that can change the way I work!</p>
