  <h2 class="centered"> The Best Coworking Spaces in Bali </h2>
  <hr class="center"> </hr>
  <p>  </p>
  <div class="posts">
   <p>Bali has a growing community of Digital Nomads and Expats living the island life. It is full of Cafe’s and coworking spaces that we all gather to work at, network and relax. Before coming to Bali I had no idea what “Coworking” was.  Coworking means the use of an office or other working environment by people who are self-employed or working for different employers, typically so as to share equipment, ideas, and knowledge. In Bali’s case, coworking is just that, sharing the wi-fi, sharing ideas and sharing contacts to grow your network and your business.</p>

<p><img src="/images/coworking.jpg" alt="A laptop setup in a home from hautestock images" height="700px" width="400px" class="blogPage-image" /></p>

<p>Dojo is one of the most popular places to cowork here in Canggu. Dojo is great because it’s 24/7, has strong wi-fi connection and tons of ways to help you network with your fellow nomads. However it can be quite expensive ($20 for a day pass) and sometimes you just want to get out of the house and work while you eat. My favorite thing to do is search out cafe’s that don’t mind you sittin’ around all day, ordering 12 coffees and 3 meals while you use the internet. The thing is, cafe’s can be great for networking as well! You’ll notice that a lot of the same people tend to hang around these places and eventually, you just get to know them all.
Some places are better for this than others, and I’ve decided to share my favorites.</p>

<h3>My favorite Coworking Spaces in Bali</h3>

<h4 class="shorelines"> 1. Oka’s Bakery and Cafe. </h4>
<p>This place wins for number 1 on my list. I am at Oka’s more often than I am at home. They are like family here. I love walking in, heading upstairs and working the morning or afternoon away. So what’s so great about Oka’s?
They have good, strong free wi-fi. Trust me, it’s pretty reliable for how Bali goes. They also have great coffee and loads of healthy food options. Their baristas are always trying out new latte art on me and I love it! The staff here are so sweet. A couple other great things about this bakery are that the prices are really affordable, especially for being such a healthy place. They have a little store as well, where you can buy drinks, fruit, bread and pastries and so much more. Lastly, they are super dog friendly. This comes in handy because I find myself dog sitting a lot, or with friends and their dogs, so we have to go places that are cool with the puppies hanging around.
Next time you’re in Canggu, check out Oka’s and let me know what you think! Whether you go to eat, relax, hangout with friends or just work, it’s an awesome atmosphere.
Oka’s Bakery and Cafe is located on Batu Bolong and is open from 7 am to 11 pm daily.</p>

<h4 class="shorelines"> 2. Little Flinders </h4>
<p>This small cafe is perfect for a quiet workplace. You won’t do much networking here but you will get a ton of crap done. The staff here are great, they are very friendly and they don’t mind at all if you want to hangout a while and work. This is important to me because sometimes I feel very uncomfortable working somewhere, where I feel like the staff is just waiting for me to leave… They also have an upstairs area that opens up later in the day, if you want to do some afternoon or evening work.
Little Flinders is also located on Batu Bolong and is open from 8 am to 10 pm.</p>

<h4 class="shorelines"> 3. Bali Bowls </h4>
<p>A great place to come for healthy creative meals, and a relatively great Wi-Fi set up. Oh, and let me mention an awesome owner who is happy to do anything to help make your experience great. The staff here love all the expats. They get so excited to hear that you will want to be coming back to see them again. This is a great place to head in the morning for a coffee and smoothie bowl. You can work for a while and then walk right down to the beach.
Bali bowls is located in Berawa (But hey that’s basically Canguu!) and is open from from 7:30 am to 10:30 pm.</p>

<h4 class="shorelines"> 4. Cabina </h4>
<p>This place has an amazing Palm Springs Vibe that I am obsessed with. It has vintage pink couches, the coolest pool and free coffee with breakfast. Could it get any better than this? I actually don’t think so. They even installed power points all over the place just to accommodate people working. It only opened about a month ago and the reason that I think I love it as much as I do is because of how new it is.
Plus after you have worked for a while you can take a dip in the pool and lay in the sun for a break. They also offer great cocktail deals and free drinks several days a week, so you can’t go wrong. Give it a go, I think you will love it too.</p>

<p>Cabina Bali is located on your way to Seminyak, just passed La Laguna. It is open from from 8 am to 11 pm.
Of course at places like Dojo you are going to have Wi-fi that claims to be unstoppable, but for $20 a day you can find a lot of great places to work and that $20 will include lunch and snacks and probably dinner. So while coworking spaces can be great, I think I’ll stick with the cafe’s for a while.</p>

<p>Check out their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cabinabali/"> Instagram </a> because they have THE greatest feed. You won’t be able to resist spending every day here.</p>
